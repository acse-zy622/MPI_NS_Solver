## Solving the Navier Stokes Equation
1. The Serial NS code is Serial_Naiver_Stokes.cpp
2. The paralleled NS is in the folder: NS_lateSub.
3. Comparison of paralleled and Serial NS_solver is in Performance_Analysis.ipynb
4. Please see HPC_results_instruction folder to locate each log file and their corresponding core numbers, recorded time.
5. Please note that these reusults of the codes are offically accessed within Imperial College London HPC system.
